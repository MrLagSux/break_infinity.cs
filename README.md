# break_infinity.cs
A replacement for break_infinity.js for incremental games (coded by C#) who want to deal with very large numbers
(bigger in magnitude than 1e308, up to as much as 1e2.147.483.647) and want to prioritize speed over accuracy.
Cant show results lower than 0, these are just not defined. (Why would you want negative values in incremental games anyway?)
