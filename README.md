# break_infinity.cs
For all the Clicker game developers who want to get rid of the number limit of 1.79e308.
A replacement for break_infinity.js for incremental games coded with C# who want to deal with very large numbers
(bigger in magnitude than 1e308, up to as much as 1e2.147.483.647) and want to prioritize speed over accuracy.
